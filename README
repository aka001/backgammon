ReadME of Backgammon AI Assignment Part2

In our program i am using Expectiminmax Search to do a 1 ply search over the tree the generate the reults of the next move..

Important Assumptions
--If the bar is empty then empty string is taken as input
--If beating off occurs in a given move then it is represented as 'O'

Initially I find all the possible states with reference to the given input upto depth of 2 level
After finding all the states i defined an evaluation function such that the average of the 
level 1 is taken and the maximum of them is taken as the max value in the root of the tree.

Evaluation Function:
	Paramaters Used:
		a)No of blots of white(i.e  my checkers)
		b)no of blots of opponent checkers
		c)no of anchors of white which are on the opponents homeboard
		d)no of anchors of white which are present anywhere(i.e. outside home board)
		e)anchors of white on 18 and 20
		f)pipcount of the stage
		g)If bearing off takes place then we use a greedy approach to remove the checkers as soon as possible.
		
	Now my evaluation function is as follows
	
		calc=10*enemy_blot+800*enemy_bar-400*holding+80*anchor-200*pip-50*(my_blot)-1500*white_checker_getting_removed;


 
Additional Features:
 The Expectiminmax works on a 1 ply search giving the appropriate results hopefully.  
 
 Refer to the pdf for any other doubt.
